# Coding challenge frontend react+typescript

Hello! If you are going through this document, we're likely chatting with you about a technical role at Pectus Finance. If so, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ !

We'd like to know a little about how you work to move forward. This document contains a set of short, time-boxed (approximately 1-3 hours max) frontend tasks that you can use to demonstrate your skills and abilities.

These are NOT coding exercises. These exercises aim to give you an asynchronous medium for demonstrating how you would break down a set of user stories and requirements into something akin to a rapid POC/spike. There is no grading or scoring, nor is it pass-fail; rather, these are meant to serve as a sample of your reductive thought processes as an engineer. We know that 3 hours is not a lot of time, and you will both not be able to complete everything you'd like and will feel pressure to do more. Please keep yourself to 3 hours max and create the README.md file as outlined in the instructions below.

## Context

Let's consider Pectus is planning to create a feature to show user uploaded expanses (you can find sample [expanses.csv](https://github.com/Pectus-Finance/hiring-exercises/blob/master/frontend/expanses.csv) file in this repository which you can use as a mock data for your work) data in tabular form and letting user to perform some basic set of operations over data such as sort and filter. You will find more fine-grained details on this under the feature scopes section.

## Feature Scopes

As a user:

- [ ] I want to see a expanses data in tabular form.
- [ ] I should able to perform sort(asc/descending order) operation by clicking on each column header
- [ ] I should able to see total sum of expanses by departments, project_name, date and by member_name
- [ ] I should able to see total sum of value in amount column

## Your Mission

Create a react application that satisfies all must-have requirements above, plus any nice-to-have requirements you wish to include.

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer (create react app, ...), but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favorite tools and packages to build a solid React application.

You can assume that you do not have to support legacy browsers. Feel free to use modern features such as **fetch** or **flexbox**.

Please use [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) - React & Typescript template for development as it would be easier for us to see and play with your work.

## Tech Requirements

- React + Typescript
- Bonus: If you use React concepts such as context, Hooks
- Bonus: Tests: Jest + react-testing-library / enzyme or end-to-end using cypress
- Code Linter, Prettier
- Bonus: CSSinJS is a plus: styled-components, styled-system, LESS, SASS ...

### Be sure to include the following in your submission

- a README.md with the following information
  - A few screenshots of the finished product. Show off that work! ðŸ“¸
  - A short explanation of what you built
- How to run/test/demo (if applicable)
  - NOTE: a 'working' exercise is fantastic, however, it is NOT a hard requirement. We mean it!
  - Any feedback/notes (i.e., if something was challenging, confusing, frustrating, etc.)
- Anything else you'd like us to know about your submission
- a WISHLIST.md with what you would add/change if you had more time. #DreamBig #NeverSettle.
- a super-simple (end to end) test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)
- Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)
- Please complete your working solution within 7 days of receiving this challenge, and be sure to notify us (nishant@pectusfinance.com) when it is ready for review.
- Please sent your task solutions (Codesandbox link/any details) at nishant@pectusfinance.com.
- If you have any questions related to this coding challenge please write to Nishant /He/Him (nishant@pectusfinance.com)
